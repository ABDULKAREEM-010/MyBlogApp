# 📖 Mega Blog App

A **full-stack blog platform** built with **React.js + Appwrite**, featuring authentication, CRUD operations, image uploads, like functionality, and a responsive UI.  

This project was created as part of my learning journey and took me **weeks of debugging and improvements** to get everything working smoothly.  



## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, React Router, Redux Toolkit, TailwindCSS  
- **Backend (BaaS)**: Appwrite (Authentication, Database, Storage, Permissions)  
- **Build Tools**: Vite, HTML React Parser, Lucide React Icons  



## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **Authentication** (Signup, Login, Logout) using Appwrite Auth  
- 📝 **CRUD for Blog Posts** (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
- 🖼️ **Image Uploads** with Appwrite Storage  
- ❤️ **Like Button** with dynamic like count per post  
- 📰 **Rich Text Rendering** using HTML React Parser  
- 🌐 **Dynamic Routing** (`/post/:slug`) with React Router  
- 📑 **Reusable Legal & Support Pages** (Privacy Policy, T&C, Licensing, Support, etc.)  
- 🎨 **Modern UI** built with TailwindCSS  
- 📱 **Fully Responsive Design** with a **sticky footer**  



## ⚡ Challenges I Faced

- Debugging **likes system** and syncing state with Appwrite  
- Fixing **sticky footer** across pages with different content lengths  
- Handling **permissions** and access rules in Appwrite  
- Structuring the app with **reusable components and pages**  
- Making the layout **pixel-perfect and responsive**
